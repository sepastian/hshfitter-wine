v0.0.2, 2019-03-15

  * Adding `PTMfitter` (cached version from Internet Archive,
    download no longer available at HP labs site.)
  * Use Windows version of `PTMfitter`, because the Linux version
    requires a 32-bit OS, which is not supported by Docker

v0.0.1, 2019-03-13

  * First commit, adding `HSHfitter` from CHI (culturalheritageinstitute.org).
